# A Web-Based Fruits and Vegetables Recognition System using ResNet50
## Introduction 
This project presents a deep learning-based fruit and vegetable classification system designed to be accurate, robust, and user-friendly. Using ResNet50 as a pretrained backbone with a custom classification head, the model was trained on resized images with data augmentation, class weights for imbalance handling, and EarlyStopping for optimization. The motivation was to create a simple, real-time tool accessible to non-technical users through a Streamlit web interface. The system is technically feasible with TensorFlow, Keras, and Streamlit, operationally practical for end-users, and economically viable since it uses free tools and public datasets. Unlike many existing works that focus only on model building, this project integrates training, optimization, and deployment in one workflow, addressing gaps in usability and robustness. The outcome is a classifier capable of recognizing 36 fruit and vegetable categories with strong performance, successfully deployed as a Streamlit app, and offering potential applications in agriculture, retail, and food technology.
## Proposed Methodology/Architecture 
The proposed system for fruit and vegetable image classification is designed for deployment as a web application, beginning with dataset preparation and ending with real-time inference via Streamlit. The hardware requirements include an Intel Core i5 CPU, 8–16GB RAM, optional NVIDIA GPU, and at least 20GB storage. The software stack comprises Python 3.9+, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and Streamlit. The dataset is organized into training, validation, and testing directories, containing multiple fruit and vegetable categories, with images resized to 180×180 pixels in JPEG or PNG format, ensuring compatibility with the deep learning model and efficient processing.
## Implementation and Results
The system was implemented using a dataset organized into training, validation, and test directories, with images automatically labeled by folder names. A custom data augmentation pipeline—including flips, rotations, zooms, and brightness/contrast adjustments—improved generalization. The ResNet50 backbone (pretrained on ImageNet) was combined with a custom classification head, trained using Sparse Categorical Crossentropy, Adam optimizer, class weights for imbalance handling, and EarlyStopping. Performance analysis showed steady training and validation accuracy with minimal overfitting, and the model achieved high test accuracy, reliably classifying multiple fruit and vegetable categories. Visualization of accuracy and loss curves confirmed stability, while single-image predictions demonstrated strong confidence, even for visually similar classes. The trained model was deployed via a Streamlit web app, enabling real-time predictions and highlighting its potential for applications in education, grocery inventory, and automated sorting systems, with room for future enhancements such as mobile or IoT integration.
## Conclusion
The developed fruit and vegetable classification system using ResNet50 achieved high accuracy and strong generalization on unseen images, handling variations in lighting, orientation, and background effectively. Deployed via a Streamlit web app, it offers an intuitive interface for users to classify images quickly, making it suitable for applications such as smart kitchens, agricultural monitoring, and retail automation. Limitations include restricted dataset diversity, sensitivity to background clutter and image quality, computational demands, and lack of real-time processing. Future improvements involve expanding the dataset, supporting real-time camera input, cloud deployment, mixed-quality training, and optimization for edge devices, enhancing the system’s robustness and applicability in real-world environments.
